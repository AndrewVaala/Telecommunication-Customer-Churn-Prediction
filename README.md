# Overview
Analyzing network services usage by customers of a Telecommunication network. Customer churn poses a major challenge in the telecommunications industry, often resulting in significant revenue losses. This project aimed to analyze customer behavioral data and develop predictive models to identify customers at risk of churning. The analysis focused on understanding key factors influencing churn and creating actionable insights for customer retention strategies.


# Objectives

The key objectives of the project were:
* To develop a predictive model capable of identifying customers at high risk of churn.
* To analyze key behavioral and usage factors such as the Customer duration (tenure), Activeness level (usage frequency or consistency), Total amount spent per customer and the Customer location.

# Data_Analysis_and_visualization
**Data Preparation**

Loaded raw data using Pandas.
Cleaned the dataset by removing irrelevant features and standardizing column names.
Handled missing values and outliers to improve data quality.

**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

Categorized columns for better interpretation.
Used correlation heatmaps to identify relationships and null values.
Generated bar charts and visual summaries for key customer segments.

**Data Preprocessing**

Applied label encoding and scaling to prepare data for machine learning models.
Defined feature and target variables for model training.
